So we hit the road.</p>

<p>We&#39;d almost made it to Rollins before she declared herself to be tired and started talking about pulling over and taking a nap. I, of course, offered to drive for a while while she slept but I think I may have oversold the degree to which my vision is impaired and she wasn&#39;t too keen on me driving. </p>

<p>We pulled into Hot Springs, drove up and down a few streets and eventually parked outside the high school. I was sent off to have a little adventure and explore Hot Springs while she took a half hour, no wait forty-five minute nap. </p>

<p>I dutifully explored. Asked at a local bar (really Hot Springs, three bars) about the hole in the ground full of hot water where we used to go when I was in high school.</p>

<p><q>Hey,</q> I says to the bartender <q>twenty, maybe twenty-five years ago there used to be a hole in the ground full of hot water over that way.</q> </p>

<p><q>Umm, twentyâ€¦</q> says the bartender. </p>

<p><q>Maybe I need to ask someone older,</q> and we both turn to look at the mustachioed guy sitting at the end of the bar. </p>

<p>The old guy explains to the young guy <q>Oh past the Simes and then up and around the corner past the old bathhouse,</q> he turns to me. <q>It got filled in, it isn&#39;t there anymore.</q> </p>

<p><q>Well that&#39;s kinda bullshit</q> says I. The old guy sits up a little straighter </p>

<p><q>Not that I don&#39;t believe you or think that what you&#39;re saying is bullshit. Just that it&#39;s too bad that it isn&#39;t there anymore,</q> I do not want trouble in Hot Springs. </p>

<p>Welcome worn out, I leave with a smile on my face. Tickled to have had to ask the old guy. Tickled to have been able to ask about something that was there <q>twenty maybe twenty-five</q> years ago. Tickled that I&#39;d had the forethought to smooth down my hair outside the bar to appear a little less alien. </p>

<p>In California, in the middle of the night, I&#39;d learned the word peregrinations - travels in a strange land. </p>

<p>Large chunks of Hot Springs are for sale. I learned this a couple doors down from the bar. There&#39;s a house. A house in town. A house for sale for $50,000. I fantasize about this for a while. Let myself pretend that I&#39;m living some other life where I&#39;m attached to this woman asleep in the car down the street. A life where a little house in a little town sounds not just bearable but appealing. </p>

<p>Stop that. </p>

<p>I keep walking, look at my phone. I&#39;d set a timer for thirty-seven minutes when I left Sarah in the car. Nineteen have elapsed. </p>

<p>There&#39;s another place for sale a couple blocks down the road. $200,000 2 lots, storefront, two bedrooms two bathrooms, a creek running through it. </p>

<p>Stop that. Keep walking. </p>

<p>If I get lost, I tell myself, if I get turned around I can just follow the bar noises until I get reoriented. Hot Springs isn&#39;t big enough to get lost in but it&#39;s dark and the stars are bright and I&#39;m glad I brought my flashlight. </p>

<p>I hear a deer run off when I get too close. Didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d been close at all.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a map at the entrance to town. Numbered squares on the left and a key on the right. Three bars, five churches, a school, a natural grocery store. I hear the police driving up behind me, give him a smile and a little wave. It could have been this guy&#39;s dad who we were afraid of twenty maybe twenty-five years ago drunk or stoned barreling down the road in Stuart&#39;s parents Oldsmobile. </p>

<p>Seven minutes left on the timer and I start walking back towards the car. Sit down the block for a few minutes so I&#39;m not lying when I wake Sarah up. </p>

<p>Turn off the timer, pop open the back of the Subaru and am confronted with the words that are the enemy of getting anywhere tonight <q>You wanna watch something on my phone? I&#39;ve got Netflix.</q> </p>

<p>Stifle a sigh, try and be sweet. My charms are no match for sleep. I climb in. </p>

<p><q>I&#39;m watching Drug Lords</q> she says like it&#39;s a selling point. </p>

<p><q>It&#39;s gonna get awfully muggy in this Subaru.</q> </p>

<p><q>You can open your window if you want,</q> climb out, find the keys, start the car, roll down the window, turn off the car, climb back in, replace the keys. </p>

<p><q>I&#39;ll be fine</q> says I </p>

<p><q>I can only sleep for like half an hour at a time,</q> she says. </p>

<p><q>I&#39;ll set another timer</q> </p>

<p><q>Don&#39;t</q> and she&#39;s lulled back into sleep by the story of El Chapo. <q>Let&#39;s just sleep here and have an adventure.</q> <em>07 12 18</em></p><p><a href="/index.html">home</a></p></body></html>
