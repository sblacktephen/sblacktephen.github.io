Chrome tabs are open to job applications and unemployment paperwork. The dishes are piling up. Somebody should really take out the garbage.</p>

<p>It can wait.</p>

<p>Procrastination is a lot like being caught in Zeno&#39;s paradox: before the dirty dishes get washed the clean dishes have to be put away. In order to put away the clean dishes, someone needs to be in the dishroom <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. To get myself to the dishroom I&#39;d first have to get out of bed. Trying to get out of bed without first buttoning up my pants might result in a cartoonish <q>pants around ankles hands full of dishes</q> scenario. To button up my pants, I first have to deal with this too-long belt I&#39;m wearing. This belt needs to be replaced with one less ridiculously long. The belt store is even father away than the dishroom and just as inaccessible. So I&#39;ll stay here in bed until the urge to pee becomes overwhelming. It&#39;s for the best, really.</p>
