<p>I am stuck in the Salt Lake City Airport.</p>

<p>It is not ideal.</p>

<p>I left home this afternoon, dripping with anxiety, heading for the airport. Security was a breeze - barely a like bearly a wait. Things were looking maybe not so bad. Then we boarded.</p>

<p>Who decided that all airline seats should have screens, and undoubtably cameras, sixteen inches away from each passengers face. Was there not an uproar? How did I miss this. I basically remember hearing about airplane TV but have known. I hadn&#39;t known it was like the.</p>

<p>I spent the first minutes of the first flight trying to figure out how to turn off the airplane TV then several more minutes trying to figure out a way to cover it up. Finally a trained my eyes past the slack dead faces of my cud chewing seatmates and tried to see what I could out the window. If course I didn&#39;t have a window seat. </p>

<p>The guy sitting next to me seemed a little disconcerted but I think he could see from the look on my face exactly what I though if someone who would choose to watch bad TV instead of look it the window when they&#39;re flying tens of thousands of feet above ground. Not Much.</p>

<p>There second flight got delayed not to be long before scheduled boarding. Then it got cancelled am hour later. So now I&#39;m trying to sleep on the airport for whole some ass hole listens to his stupid Jesus show in his phone.</p>

<p>A pox on Utah.</p>

<p>They did provide blankets and pillows for those of us who are sleeping on the floor. They&#39;re a little insulting</p>

<p><a href="/img/blankets.jpg">Airport Blankets</a></p>

<p>Those are the florescent lights off the airport shining through the provided blankets. I had to beg and plead for one between the <q>I&#39;ve got four people in my group</q> and <q>as a first class passenger I need blankets and pillows</q> </p>

<p><q>I am no longer adhering to social conventions,</q> is a helpful phrase it turns out and it gets you a blanket.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t even vape.</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m in an airport</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been dripping high test bake juice onto indeed cards like blotter. It&#39;s working. It could be working better.</p>

<hr>

<p>It&#39;s midnight now. I suppose I should try and get some sleep.</p>

<p>The worst part about these little disasters is the whole<em>cycle of feeling bad</em> that I get into with Dad. Something bad happens and I feel bad and don&#39;t want to tell him least he feel bad but he finds out and hells bad that it happened and I didn&#39;t tell him and then I feel badâ€¦ jeesh</p>

<p>Goodnight</p><p><a href="/index.html">home</a></p></body></html>
