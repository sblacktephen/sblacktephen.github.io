Today I went to the [Northwest Cannabis Club](https://www.nwcannabismarket.com/) for the third time. The first time was awful; a confusing and cringy filming of some guys comedy special. It's a private club with an official looking membership card complete with meaningless id number and barcode. I like carrying it around.

Four months after the first visit, on what was undeniably the hottest day of the year, I returned.
The sun was beating down, the temperature was rising, and I missed the cool embrace of a dark bar. But bars and I have parted ways and the Northwest Cannabis Club is an absolutely perfect substitute for that dank *day-drinker* vibe without the drinking. I set up shop in the enormous basement, sharing it with three other people. For a five dollar entry fee I got six hours of access to their air conditioned basement and shaded patio. **Nobody asked me to buy anything.** I was able to purchase a red bull and some candy but the prices were reasonable, even cheap. I can not even begin to understand how this is a viable business model or why the place isn't packed every day, filled with artsy-stoney twenty-somethings. You don't even have to get high. You just have to tolerate other people getting high. Maybe if it wasn't a filthy dumpâ€¦ who knows.

The place is great. Early. I have not spent any time at the NWCC after six pm. It may be very very different. Early though, early has a lot of possibilities. I have some ideas about a place like the Northwest Cannabis Club but that embraced the possibilities of the early - of morning light through colored glass. Places a little less gross where regular day people could go. But I wouldn't like those places. I like the dank. I like being able to be somewhere and not really give a shit.

So for now I'll keep going back to the NWCC. Until it dies the death of every business in that building. Bars, furniture stores, used car lots, an escape room. Barnacles. Or until there is some shift and things take off for the NWCC. I hope they figure it out and good on em if they do. I hope it is a harbinger of something interesting and new. Either way, even if I never go back, I'll miss it when it's the next gross thing.
