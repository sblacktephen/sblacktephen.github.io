Today, there is nothing that cannot wait until tomorrow. Chrome tabs are open to job applications and unemployment paperwork. The dishes are piling up. Somebody should really take out the garbage.

It can wait.

Procrastination is a lot like being caught in Zeno's paradox: before the dirty dishes get washed the clean dishes have to be put away. In order to put away the clean dishes, someone needs to be in the dishroom [^1]. To get myself to the dishroom I'd first have to get out of bed. Trying to get out of bed without first buttoning up my pants might result in a cartoonish "pants around ankles hands full of dishes" scenario. To button up my pants, I first have to deal with this too-long belt I'm wearing. This belt needs to be replaced with one less ridiculously long. The belt store is even father away than the dishroom and just as inaccessible. So I'll stay here in bed until the urge to pee becomes overwhelming. It's for the best, really.


[^1]: **dishroom :** The little room off the main kitchen where there's a sink and rubbing water and stuff. The "kitchen" is an expanse of linoleum, a couple cupboard, an oven and a refrigerator.
