I am stuck in the Salt Lake City Airport.

It is not ideal.

I left home this afternoon, dripping with anxiety, heading for the airport. Security was a breeze - barely a like bearly a wait. Things were looking maybe not so bad. Then we boarded.

Who decided that all airline seats should have screens, and undoubtably cameras, sixteen inches away from each passengers face. Was there not an uproar? How did I miss this. I basically remember hearing about airplane TV but have known. I hadn't known it was like the.

I spent the first minutes of the first flight trying to figure out how to turn off the airplane TV then several more minutes trying to figure out a way to cover it up. Finally a trained my eyes past the slack dead faces of my cud chewing seatmates and tried to see what I could out the window. If course I didn't have a window seat. 

The guy sitting next to me seemed a little disconcerted but I think he could see from the look on my face exactly what I though if someone who would choose to watch bad TV instead of look it the window when they're flying tens of thousands of feet above ground. Not Much.

There second flight got delayed not to be long before scheduled boarding. Then it got cancelled am hour later. So now I'm trying to sleep on the airport for whole some ass hole listens to his stupid Jesus show in his phone.

A pox on Utah.

They did provide blankets and pillows for those of us who are sleeping on the floor. They're a little insulting

Those are the florescent lights off the airport shining through the provided blankets. I had to beg and plead for one between the "I've got four people in my group" and "as a first class passenger I need blankets and pillows" 

"I am no longer adhering to social conventions," is a helpful phrase it turns out and it gets you a blanket.

I can't even vape.

Because I'm in an airport

I've been dripping high test bake juice onto indeed cards like blotter. It's working. It could be working better.

It's midnight now. I suppose I should try and get some sleep.

The worst part about these little disasters is the whole*cycle of feeling bad* that I get into with Dad. Something bad happens and I feel bad and don't want to tell him least he feel bad but he finds out and hells bad that it happened and I didn't tell him and then I feel badâ€¦ jeesh

Goodnight
